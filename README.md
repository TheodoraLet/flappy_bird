## Flappy bird using C and ncurses.
This is a flappy bird ~philosophy~ game that uses ncurses. The user has 3 lives and can collect points that both appear at the upper left side of the terminal. In order to model the fact that the bird falls if no button is pressed, a sigaction is used on a SIGALRM of a timer that fires every one second and every so it decreases the hight of the bird. 

## How to play
By using up and down key.
